# library

A personal library project integrating recent learnings in Javascript with my current knowledge in HTML & CSS. 

## Reflection
major learnings/exercised: 
- prototype inheritance
- objects
- "separation of duties" (particularly data storage and displaying)
- tables
- content within tables: wrapping, width
- flex & grid together
- processing data from forms
- dialog
- data-* attribute
- defining classes for common attributes like "major buttons"
