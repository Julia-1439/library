# library

A personal library project created using Javascript object constructors and classes. 

## Reflection
major learnings/exercised: 
- prototype inheritance
- objects
- "separation of logic" (particularly internal storage and displaying)
- tables
- content within tables: wrapping, width
- flex & grid together
- processing data from forms
- dialog
- data-* attribute
- defining css classes for common attributes like "major buttons"
- checking & testing browser compatability
- classes

Time spent: 20 hours + 1:45 hour incorporating feedback + 1:30 assignment to refactor using classes and redocument code (why am I timing myself so rigorously? I don't know.)

Known bug: Samsung Internet does not show the modal when clicking Add a Book.
